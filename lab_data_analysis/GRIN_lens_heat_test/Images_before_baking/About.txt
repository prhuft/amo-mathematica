1- Room light was off, except for one row far away from the setup.

2- from image 1 to 6 I move the GRIN lens assembly one increment in each step moving away from the lens.

3- Image 7 is the minimum spot size again

4- from image 8 to 10 I move the stage (with the GRIN lens assembly) towards the imaging lens; one increment in each step.

5- I change the laser power each time to get a good SNR.
